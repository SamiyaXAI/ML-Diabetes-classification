Steps performed":

Load Data: Read the diabetes dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and check its structure.
Check for Missing Values: Verify if the dataset contains any missing values.
Visualize Correlations: Generate a heatmap to analyze feature correlations.
Convert Target Variable: Ensure the target column (diabetes) is in integer format.
Count Target Classes: Count the number of diabetic (1) and non-diabetic (0) cases.
Split Data: Divide the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
Identify Missing (Zero) Values: Check how many rows contain zero values for key features.
Handle Missing Values: Replace zeros in specific columns with the mean of that feature.
Train Random Forest Model:
Initialize a Random Forest Classifier
Train the Random Forest model on the training data
Make predictions on the test set and calculate accuracy
Optimize Hyperparameters for XGBoost:
Define a range of hyperparameters
Use RandomizedSearchCV to find the best combination
Measure time taken for tuning
Evaluate XGBoost Model:
Get the best model from the search
Perform cross-validation with the best model
Print the average score across folds
This process involves training and evaluating both the Random Forest and XGBoost models for diabetes prediction.
